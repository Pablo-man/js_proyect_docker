## :open_book: How to use
* Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Pablo-man/js_proyect_docker.git
    ```
> [!NOTE]
> Because the application is made up of statistical files, these must be served on a web server, so the VSCode code editor will be used together with the live server extension in this example.

* Once the project has been cloned, you must open it with the VSCode code editor with the Live Server extension previously installed

* Inside the editor, open the index.html file and press the button corresponding to the mentioned extension, which is located in the lower right area of ​​the editor window

### Run image
```
docker run --name <NEWCONTAINERNAME> -d -p 8080:80 <IMAGENAME>
```

## :light_rail: PAAS Deploy with docker (Railway)
For its deployment in a PAAS we will rely on railway and its easy implementation thanks to its container management. 

![Railway Service](./public/img/railwayDeploy.png "Service")

The platform automatically uses our Dockerfile to build the container. 

![Build Container](./public/img/dockerFile.png "Build Configuration")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Next, the configuration that we must add is the generation of a domain along with the desired port, in this case the indicated thing would be to point to port 80 on which nginx is working

![Generate Domain](./public/img/domain.png "Domain")
